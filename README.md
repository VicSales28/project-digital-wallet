# Digital Wallet 💰

This project was developed while I was studying Redux in React Applications at Trybe Programming School.

In this project I developed an expense control wallet with a currency converter.

When using this application, a user should be able to:

- Add and remove an expense;
- View a table with your expenses;
- View the total spend converted to a specific currency;

  <summary><strong>🔎 Linter</strong></summary><br />

To ensure code quality, the `ESLint` and `Stylelint` linters were used in this project.

ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. In many ways it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions:

* ESLint uses Espree for JavaScript parsing.
* ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code.
* ESLint is completely 'pluggable', each of the rules is a plugin and you can add […]

To run them locally, run the commands below:
`npm run lint`
`npm run lint:styles`
